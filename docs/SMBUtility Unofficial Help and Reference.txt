üçÑ1: BasicsüçÑ
----------------

‚Ä¢ Click on the Yellow Excavator icon to change objects (bricks, blocks, pipes, etc.)
   - Goes to Map Mode
           o This includes Ladders

‚Ä¢ Click on the Red Turtle Shell icon to change enemies (goombas, lifts, etc.)
   - Goes to Badguys Mode
   - This includes: 
           o Page Skips (such as the halfway point) 
           o Room Changes (down a pipe)
           o Lifts (moving platforms)

‚Ä¢ Edit --> Choose Room (or pipe icon) to switch levels. 
   - Green Pipe button on the Toolbar. 
   - Note: The bonus areas (underground, in beanstalks, etc.) are in different rooms. 

‚Ä¢ Double Left Click on object or enemy to change properties (type, position, etc.)
   - You can also double Left click on the object in the map screen. 
   - Or drag it around on the map screen. 

‚Ä¢ Right Click --> Send Object to change location of an object or enemy (a different page, room). 
   - Page = screen within a level. 
   - Room = level (or bonus area). 


üåª2: Detailsüåª
----------------

‚Ä¢ The Length of bricks is their horizontal length (and secret blocks can be hidden inside). 

‚Ä¢ The Length of pipes is their vertical height. There are also other blocks that are aligned vertically. 

‚Ä¢ Some groups of enemies are denoted by their FIXED vertical position. 
   - V=10 (on ground level)
   - V=6 (on typical block height)

‚Ä¢ If you have 4 or more objects which start at the same vertical column, they will GLITCH and you will not see most of the other objects on THAT page. 
   - There are other limitations on the number of objects per page. 

‚Ä¢ Sometimes if you move the Page skip even slightly within a page, other objects (and enemies) will move several pages over INSTANTLY. 
   - I ran into this issue near the halfway poin of 8-1, and then I just moved the page skip back. 


‚Ä¢ The Room change (enemies) change from the current level map to a different level map. 
  Note: Even if the Room changes it will not change the level designation (unless it is a warp zone). 
   - [25H(Ground), w=1, p=10] means go to Room 25 [H] and Page 10 if you are on World 1.  
   - [28H(Ground), w=2, p=7] means go to Room 28 [H] and Page 7 if you are on World 2.  
   - [40H(Underground), w=1, p=7] means go to Room 40 [H] and Page 7 if you are on World 1.  


‚Ä¢ Scenes (at V=14, H=0) determine the the floor, ceilings, backgrounds, etc.
   - You can edit the object to change the scene (note that it will probably change the background for the previous page as well). 

- Dropping down the floor (for things like coins) doesn't get you stuck. 

- A lot of times when you jam too many prizes on one page, some of them start disappearing even if they are visible in the level editor. 

‚Ä¢ Note that there is a checkbox in the Edit box for enemies (including lifts) that allows them to appear after level 5-3 (the default Hard level). 
  - This is because there are several levels that are repeats, just with more enemies and smaller lifts. 


üê¢üçÑ3: Warp ZonesüçÑüê¢
-------------------

‚Ä¢ This changes the text headers (which is what the Warp Zone object is) AND the pipe destinations. 
Tools --> Edit Some Game Stuff --> Warp Zones
Warp Zone 1 -->  4   3   2 (end of 1-2)
Warp Zone 2 --> 36   5  36 (end of 4-2)
Warp Zone 3 -->  8   7   6 (vine in 4-2)

     o So if the left pipe destination is 4, then going down that pipe will send the player to World 4-1. 
     o Also that pipe destination 36 is no destination. It will show up as blank on the screen, but if a pipe is there it will take the player to a glitched level. 


‚Ä¢ To alter the locations 
   - Take the pipes and move them to a different level. 

‚Ä¢ Room Change (vine) --> Mushroom Hill Warp Zone 
   - You will not be able to move this with the Send Object command
   - Instead move an enemy from that level to the desired page
   - Then Edit the enemy and change the binary (which is actually hexcode) 1e 2f 60 
   - You will also need to change the world in the Edit box (so the correct level shows up in the HUD). 
   - Note that because the hexcode is so long, it will actually glitch all of the enemies after that point in the level, but you can edit them back to normal.

 Õû                        Õû Õû 
- I'm not sure why some objects / enemies cannot be rearranged. 
- I'm not sure why the exit pipes in the underground bonus rooms disappear when you rearrange other objects. (see in Details above)
- I'm not sure why the jump board sometimes glitches. 
        o Is it due to the vertical location of where its placed. (Try V = 9)
        o Usually it works fine.  
        o But sometimes (without any changes) the invisible jump board just happens (Mario gets stuck).  
             - note this glitch is occasionally seen when running the original game on actual hardware. 
- I'm not sure what the page flags do.

|        Loop (Maze)          |

Tools --> Edit Looping Castle 

World (+1 to get displayed World #)
   03 03 06 06 06 06 06 06 07 07 07

Page (end of a loop segment)

   12 36 0e 0e 0e 32 32 32 0a 26 40

World 7's loop
    World  06    06

Notice how the V pos values all have zeroes for the last digit. So disregard the last digit and take the first digit only as the vertical position. 

Take the value and -1 ? to find where the invisible loop flag is. 

**

EXAMPLE (the first two columns of data):

World (+1 to get displayed World #)
   03 03

Page (end of a loop segment)
   05 09

V pos (vertical position)
   40 b0

Offset of map page skip data   [horizontal offset?]
   12 36

This means in the castle in World 4 (the only type of level that can have a looping maze), there are two loops. The first loop ends on page 05 with its vertical position at 3 (since 4 - 1 = 3) and a horizontal position of 12 on that page. The second loop ends on page 09 with its vertical position at 10 (since 0b - 01 = 0a = 10 in decimal) and a horizontal position of 36 on that page.
