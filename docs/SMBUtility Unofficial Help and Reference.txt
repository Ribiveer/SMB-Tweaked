🍄1: Basics🍄
----------------

• Click on the Yellow Excavator icon to change objects (bricks, blocks, pipes, etc.)
   - Goes to Map Mode
           o This includes Ladders

• Click on the Red Turtle Shell icon to change enemies (goombas, lifts, etc.)
   - Goes to Badguys Mode
   - This includes: 
           o Page Skips (such as the halfway point) 
           o Room Changes (down a pipe)
           o Lifts (moving platforms)

• Edit --> Choose Room (or pipe icon) to switch levels. 
   - Green Pipe button on the Toolbar. 
   - Note: The bonus areas (underground, in beanstalks, etc.) are in different rooms. 

• Double Left Click on object or enemy to change properties (type, position, etc.)
   - You can also double Left click on the object in the map screen. 
   - Or drag it around on the map screen. 

• Right Click --> Send Object to change location of an object or enemy (a different page, room). 
   - Page = screen within a level. 
   - Room = level (or bonus area). 


🌻2: Details🌻
----------------

• The Length of bricks is their horizontal length (and secret blocks can be hidden inside). 

• The Length of pipes is their vertical height. There are also other blocks that are aligned vertically. 

• Some groups of enemies are denoted by their FIXED vertical position. 
   - V=10 (on ground level)
   - V=6 (on typical block height)

• If you have 4 or more objects which start at the same vertical column, they will GLITCH and you will not see most of the other objects on THAT page. 
   - There are other limitations on the number of objects per page. 

• Sometimes if you move the Page skip even slightly within a page, other objects (and enemies) will move several pages over INSTANTLY. 
   - I ran into this issue near the halfway poin of 8-1, and then I just moved the page skip back. 


• The Room change (enemies) change from the current level map to a different level map. 
  Note: Even if the Room changes it will not change the level designation (unless it is a warp zone). 
   - [25H(Ground), w=1, p=10] means go to Room 25 [H] and Page 10 if you are on World 1.  
   - [28H(Ground), w=2, p=7] means go to Room 28 [H] and Page 7 if you are on World 2.  
   - [40H(Underground), w=1, p=7] means go to Room 40 [H] and Page 7 if you are on World 1.  


• Scenes (at V=14, H=0) determine the the floor, ceilings, backgrounds, etc.
   - You can edit the object to change the scene (note that it will probably change the background for the previous page as well). 

- Dropping down the floor (for things like coins) doesn't get you stuck. 

- A lot of times when you jam too many prizes on one page, some of them start disappearing even if they are visible in the level editor. 

• Note that there is a checkbox in the Edit box for enemies (including lifts) that allows them to appear after level 5-3 (the default Hard level). 
  - This is because there are several levels that are repeats, just with more enemies and smaller lifts. 


🐢🍄3: Warp Zones🍄🐢
-------------------

• This changes the text headers (which is what the Warp Zone object is) AND the pipe destinations. 
Tools --> Edit Some Game Stuff --> Warp Zones
Warp Zone 1 -->  4   3   2 (end of 1-2)
Warp Zone 2 --> 36   5  36 (end of 4-2)
Warp Zone 3 -->  8   7   6 (vine in 4-2)

     o So if the left pipe destination is 4, then going down that pipe will send the player to World 4-1. 
     o Also that pipe destination 36 is no destination. It will show up as blank on the screen, but if a pipe is there it will take the player to a glitched level. 


• To alter the locations 
   - Take the pipes and move them to a different level. 

• Room Change (vine) --> Mushroom Hill Warp Zone 
   - You will not be able to move this with the Send Object command
   - Instead move an enemy from that level to the desired page
   - Then Edit the enemy and change the binary (which is actually hexcode) 1e 2f 60 
   - You will also need to change the world in the Edit box (so the correct level shows up in the HUD). 
   - Note that because the hexcode is so long, it will actually glitch all of the enemies after that point in the level, but you can edit them back to normal. 




⭐🌟4: Edit --> Edit Header🌟⭐

• Basic Brick = Sets the starting scene for the level (ground and / or ceiling)

|❔|6: Further Questions |❔|
 ͞                        ͞ ͞ 
- I'm not sure why some objects / enemies cannot be rearranged. 
- I'm not sure why the exit pipes in the underground bonus rooms disappear when you rearrange other objects. (see in Details above)
- I'm not sure why the jump board sometimes glitches. 
        o Is it due to the vertical location of where its placed. (Try V = 9)
        o Usually it works fine.  
        o But sometimes (without any changes) the invisible jump board just happens (Mario gets stuck).  
             - note this glitch is occasionally seen when running the original game on actual hardware. 
- I'm not sure what the page flags do.

|        Loop (Maze)          |

Tools --> Edit Looping Castle 

World (+1 to get displayed World #)
   03 03 06 06 06 06 06 06 07 07 07

Page (end of a loop segment)

World 7's loop
    World  06    06

Notice how the V pos values all have zeroes for the last digit. So disregard the last digit and take the first digit only as the vertical position. 

Take the value and -1 ? to find where the invisible loop flag is. 

**

EXAMPLE (the first two columns of data):

World (+1 to get displayed World #)
   03 03

Page (end of a loop segment)
   05 09

V pos (vertical position)
   40 b0

Offset of map page skip data   [horizontal offset?]
   12 36

This means in the castle in World 4 (the only type of level that can have a looping maze), there are two loops. The first loop ends on page 05 with its vertical position at 3 (since 4 - 1 = 3) and a horizontal position of 12 on that page. The second loop ends on page 09 with its vertical position at 10 (since 0b - 01 = 0a = 10 in decimal) and a horizontal position of 36 on that page.
