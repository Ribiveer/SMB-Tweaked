This patch has the following changes:

----- Music Changes -----
x There is now music on the title screen: an alternate version of the underwater theme.

----- Bug Fixes & Small Tweaks -----
x Lakitus now throw their spinies as originally intended by the programmers.
x Falling while crouching now keeps your sprite crouched.
x While underwater, crouching no longer messes up the hitbox.
x Stars are now guaranteed to jump out of their blocks, as opposed to sometimes falling down.
x The lives counter now displays the number of lives above 9 like normal.
x Lives are now capped at 99 to prevent glitches.
x Mario no longer loses vertical momentum while collecting a power-up. As a result, the glitch where Mario could jump from a power-up has also been fixed.
x Getting the flagpole stops the star invincibility, to prevent audio glitches.
x Holding the run button while Fire Mario no longer makes him fire a fireball while entering an area.
x Holding the jump button no longer makes Mario jump while entering an area.
x The scrolling now properly stops in warp zone areas.
x Faulty warp pipes have now been linked to Bowser's sewage system.
x Kicked shells now keep their momentum while going off a ledge.
x The fortress in 5-1 has been changed to a castle, for consistency.
x Fire Mario and Fire Luigi now have separate palettes.
x Green Cheep Cheeps now appear green underwater.
x The lives screen now properly reflects Mario's power-up state.
x When entering a warp-pipe, Small Mario will now always stand still and Big Mario will now always crouch.
x Both players can now always pause the game.

----- Modernised Quality of Life Mechanics -----
x Holding A now allows you to bounce on enemies higher, like in later entries.
x Getting a Fire Flower as Small Mario now turns Mario into Fire Mario, as opposed to Super Mario.
x Getting hit as Fire Mario now turns Mario into Super Mario, as opposed to Small Mario.
x Hidden 1-up blocks no longer despawn after dying.
x Hitting the top of the flagpole now gives Mario a 1-up.
x Defeating consecutive enemies with a Super Star now gives you more points, eventually giving 1-ups!
x Defeating consecutive enemies now increases the sound effect pitch with every enemy.

----- Enemy Behaviour Changes -----
x Hammers now travel along their arc, regardless of whether they touch Mario. They do get bounced when Mario has a star.
x Enemies like Goombas, Koopas, Buzzy Beetles and Spinies now only change direction when walking into a wall, or when turning around on a ledge.
x It is now possible to defeat Spinies by hitting blocks underneath them.

----- PAL Version Changes -----
x Cheep Cheep code has been optimised.
x The system that detects whether Mario has stomped an enemy has been improved.
x Fixed springs being able to get overwritten in memory, or overwriting other memory.
x Some enemies now have a slightly higher hitbox.
x Spring acceleration is now defined (whatever that means).
