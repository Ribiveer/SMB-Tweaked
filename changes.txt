This patch has the following changes:

----- Music Changes -----
x There is now music on the title screen: an alternate version of the underwater theme.
- The final victory song has been extended, with a B-section and an end.

----- Bug Fixes & Small Tweaks -----
x Lakitus now throw their spinies as originally intended by the programmers.
x Falling while crouching now keeps your sprite crouched.
x While underwater, crouching no longer messes up the hitbox.
- Small Mario's walking animation is now fixed, as opposed to playing in reverse.
- Stars are now guaranteed to jump out of their blocks, as opposed to sometimes falling down.
x The lives counter now displays the number of lives above 9 like normal.
x Lives are now capped at 99 to prevent glitches.
x Mario no longer loses vertical momentum while collecting a power-up. As a result, the glitch where Mario could jump from a power-up has also been fixed.
x Getting the flagpole stops the star invincibility, to prevent audio glitches.
- Holding the run button while Fire Mario no longer makes him fire a fireball while entering an area.
- Holding the jump button no longer makes Mario jump while entering an area.
x The scrolling now properly stops in warp zone areas.
x Faulty warp pipes have now been linked to Bowser's sewage system.
- Kicked shells now keep their momentum while going off a ledge.
- The fortress in 5-1 has been changed to a castle, for consistency.
x Fire Mario and Fire Luigi now have separate palettes.
x Green Cheep Cheeps now appear green underwater.
x The lives screen now properly reflects Mario's power-up state.
x When entering a warp-pipe, Small Mario will now always stand still and Big Mario will now always crouch.
- Mario now has a death animation when falling down a pit.
- Both players can now always pause the game.

----- Modernised Quality of Life Mechanics -----
x Holding A now allows you to bounce on enemies higher, like in later entries.
x Getting a Fire Flower as Small Mario now turns Mario into Fire Mario, as opposed to Super Mario.
x Getting hit as Fire Mario now turns Mario into Super Mario, as opposed to Small Mario.
x Hidden 1-up blocks no longer despawn after dying.
- Hitting the top of the flagpole now gives Mario a 1-up.
- Defeating consecutive enemies with a Super Star now gives you more points, eventually giving 1-ups!
- Defeating consecutive enemies now increases the sound effect pitch with every enemy.

----- Enemy Behaviour Changes -----
- Hammers now travel along their arc, regardless of whether they touch Mario.
- Enemies like Goombas, Koopas, Buzzy Beetles and Spinies now only change direction when walking into a wall, or when turning around on a ledge.
- It is now possible to defeat Spinies by hitting blocks underneath them.

----- PAL Version Changes -----
x Cheep Cheep code has been optimised.
- Pipes at the end of underwater levels now don't have an empty block above them.
- The system that detects whether Mario has stomped an enemy has been improved.
- Fixed springs being able to get overwritten in memory, or overwriting other memory.
- Some enemies now have a slightly higher hitbox.
- Spring acceleration is now defined (whatever that means).

----- Graphics Changes -----
- Added small one-pixel graphics tweaks to Buzzy Beetles, Hammer Bros. and Toad.
- Made the outlines of bushes and clouds continuous.
- Utulised an extra sprite to add a small animation to Piranha Plants.
- Made Toad smile more :) (might revert this change honestly)
- The hands of Mario's growing sprite and jump sprite have been fixed.
- Hammer Bros. now bob up and down in their animation as well.
- Super Mario's jump sprite has been fixed to match the eyes and cap of the other sprites.


possible things to do next:
Move the timer sound effect to the other channel, so you can hear the melody of the fanfare
add maze fail and complete sound
add lives counter in-game
Make crouching possible while holding left-right
Fix hammer bros. eyes while throwing
Make bowser flash when hit with a fireball
Optimise enemy rendering code
Fix mario's starting jump momentum thing that gets him flying off the bowser stairs

----- From PAL Revision B -----
The exclamation mark has been resized.
The dot has been aligned upper. 
The cross graphic by the coin counter has been aligned upper. 

known bugs:
throwing a fireball briefly before getting damaged and grabbing another fire flower, spawns a random fireball underneath Mario.
Breaking the bricks underneath a koopa troopa doesn't give you points
Sometimes, the end of the flagpole (even when getting a 1-up instead of points) messes up the score display a bit.
